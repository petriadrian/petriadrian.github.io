Because the youths are moving to cities and some of the peoples were relocated by the Canadian mining company, the number of inhabitants and farmers has decreased. In order to take care of the hay meadows and to preserve the tradition of hay making, it would be really helpful for the farmers who are still living here to have somebody to help. This is a great opportunity for nature lovers and those interested in traditional culture and sustainable living  to learn about the connections between nature and farming and help to preserve valuable mountain hay meadows and their plant, wildlife and traditions. In the evening we will participate at the cow milking and have a rest at the farm were the host will make a dinner as a reward. In one of the days we will go in a guided tour of the village to tell you more about the history and the local habits.",
