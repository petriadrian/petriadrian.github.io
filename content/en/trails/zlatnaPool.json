The proof is this luxurious public pool and the pedestrian alley next to it. But, to reach the 'revitalizing' pool, you'll have to pedal up on the 'Dealul Mare' hill, through beech and coniferous forests. The more exhausted you are when you reach Zlatna, the better the bath will be :) . You can visit also here what was left from the mining industrial plant. The trail is on asphalted roads and it can be made by car/moto or touring bikes. <b>The below indications represents one way length and time.</b>",
